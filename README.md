# Product-Analytics-System

End-to-End Product Analysis using Power BI and Backend Data Integration

This project implements a complete data analytics architecture for product performance monitoring by integrating backend data sources with Power BI. Data is ingested from structured sources such as SQL databases and REST APIs, transformed using ETL processes, and modeled into analytical schemas suitable for reporting.
The solution leverages DevOps pipelines for automating data refresh, version control, and deployment of analytical assets. Data processing includes data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation to compute business metrics and KPIs. Power BI is used as the visualization layer to create interactive dashboards that support real-time and historical product analysis.
Key technical components include:
Backend data integration (SQL / APIs)
ETL and data transformation workflows
Data modeling for analytics
Power BI dashboard development
DevOps automation (CI/CD, scheduled refresh)
Data visualization and KPI reporting
This project demonstrates how enterprise-grade analytics systems combine data engineering, business intelligence, and DevOps practices to deliver scalable and maintainable analytical solutions.
